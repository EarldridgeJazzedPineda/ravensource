Surf is the web browser by the suckless.org community. It's based on 
webkit2 and GTK+3 and aims to be a very simple browser. As such it only 
displays webpages and allows for following links. Surf deliberately does 
not support tabs.

To browse to a page, start the program and give the URL as a parameter. 
Surf supports dmenu, though.
