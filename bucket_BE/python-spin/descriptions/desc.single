# 💫 Scientific Python INcantations (`spin`)

## A developer tool for scientific Python libraries

Developers need to memorize a whole bunch of magic command-line
incantations.
And these incantations change from time to time!
Typically, their lives are made simpler by a Makefile, but Makefiles can be
convoluted, are not written in Python, and are hard to extend.
The rationale behind `spin` is therefore to provide a simple interface for
common development tasks.
It comes with a few common build commands out the box, but can easily be
customized per project.

As a curiosity: the impetus behind developing the tool was the mass
migration of scientific Python libraries (SciPy, scikit-image, and NumPy,
etc.) to Meson, after distutils was deprecated.
When many of the build and installation commands changed, it made sense to
abstract away the nuisance of having to re-learn them.

## Installation

`
pip install spin
`

## Configuration

Settings are stored in `.spin.toml`, `spin.toml`, or your project's
`pyproject.toml`.
As an example, see the `[tool.spin]` section of [an example
`pyproject.toml`].

The `[project]` section should contain `name`.
The `[tool.spin]` section should contain:

```
package = "pkg_importname"  # name of your package
commands = [
  "spin.cmds.meson.build",
  "spin.cmds.meson.test"
]
```

See [the command selection] below.

### Command sections

Once you have several commands, it may be useful to organize them into
sections.
In `pyproject.toml`, instead of specifying the commands as a list, use the
following structure:

```toml
[tool.spin.commands]
"Build" = [
  "spin.cmds.meson.build",
  "spin.cmds.meson.test"
]
"Environments" = [
  "spin.cmds.meson.ipython",
  "spin.cmds.meson.run"
]
```

These commands will then be rendered as:

```
Build:
  build  🔧 Build package with Meson/ninja and install
  test   🔧 Run tests

Environments:
  ipython  💻 Launch IPython shell with PYTHONPATH set
  run      🏁 Run a shell command with PYTHONPATH set
```

## Running

`
spin
`

or

```
python -m spin
```

## Built-in commands

### [Meson]

Available as `spin.cmds.meson.*`.

```
  build    🔧 Build package with Meson/ninja and install to
`build-install`
  ipython  💻 Launch IPython shell with PYTHONPATH set
  python   🐍 Launch Python shell with PYTHONPATH set
