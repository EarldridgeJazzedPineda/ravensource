curl: A Modern and Flexible Web Client for R

Bindings to 'libcurl' &lt;<a href="https://curl.se/libcurl/"
target="_top">https://curl.se/libcurl/</a>&gt; for performing fully
configurable HTTP/FTP requests where responses can be processed in memory,
on disk, or streaming via the callback or connection interfaces. Some
knowledge of 'libcurl' is recommended; for a more-user-friendly web client
see the 'httr2' package which builds on this package with http specific
tools and logic.
