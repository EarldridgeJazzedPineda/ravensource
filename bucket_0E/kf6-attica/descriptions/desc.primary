Attica is a Qt library that implements the Open Collaboration Services API 
(version 1.6). The REST API is defined here:

https://freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/open-collaboration-services/o

It grants easy access to the services such as querying information about 
persons and contents. The library is used in KNewStuff3 as content 
provider. In Order to integrate with KDE's Plasma Desktop, a platform 
plugin exists in kdebase.
