graphlayouts: Additional Layout Algorithms for Network Visualizations

Several new layout algorithms to visualize networks are provided which are
not part of 'igraph'. Most are based on the concept of stress majorization
by Gansner et al. (2004) &lt;<a

Some more specific algorithms allow to emphasize hidden group structures in
networks or focus on specific nodes.
