This is the official C implementation of BLAKE3.

This package compiles the individual files to provide the blake3 library.
Unlike the Rust implementation, the C implementation doesn't currently
support multithreading.

The x86-64 package leverages the provided assembly files.
Other platforms will build with intrinics (when supported).
