mvtnorm: Multivariate Normal and t Distributions

Computes multivariate normal and t probabilities, quantiles, random
deviates, and densities. Log-likelihoods for multivariate Gaussian models
and Gaussian copulae parameterised by Cholesky factors of covariance or
precision matrices are implemented for interval-censored and exact data, or
a mix thereof. Score functions for these log-likelihoods are available. A
class representing multiple lower triangular matrices and corresponding
methods are part of this package.
