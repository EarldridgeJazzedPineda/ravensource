mold is a faster drop-in replacement for existing Unix linkers.  It is
several times quicker than the LLVM lld linker, the second-fastest
open-source linker, which I initially developed a few years ago. mold
aims to enhance developer productivity by minimizing build time,
particularly in rapid debug-edit-rebuild cycles.
