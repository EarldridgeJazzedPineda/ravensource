The projectM Expression Evaluation Library, "projectm-eval" in short, is a 
cross-platform and cross-architecture reimplementation of Milkdrop's 
pendant, the NullSoft Expression Evaluation Library 2, or short "ns-eel2".

This library aims at being as portable as possible, sacrificing some 
performance over portability. The original ns-eel2 library directly 
assembles machine code from compiled assembler fragments. While this is 
super performant, the assembler code needs to be rewritten manually for 
every target platform and CPU architecture and is really hard to read or 
edit.
