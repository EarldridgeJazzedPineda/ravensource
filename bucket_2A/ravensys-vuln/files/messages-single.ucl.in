To populate the database, see comments in the 
%%PREFIX%%/share/ravensys-vuln/structure.sql file.
Once the mysql/mariadb server is ready, finish the configuration
by editing the %%PREFIX%%/etc/vuln.conf file.

To run the scraper daily, either set a cron task
    e.g [ 5 21 * * * %%PREFIX%%/bin/rpaudit.sh ]
    Note: see comments in rpaudit.sh to rotate /var/log/rpaudit logs

-or- by adding the following lines to /etc/periodic.conf:

local_periodic="%%PREFIX%%/etc/periodic /usr/local/etc/periodic"
daily_rp_audit_enable="YES"
daily_output="/var/log/daily.log"

The latter is not recommended unless the daily output is sent
to the daily.log rather than the root's mail.
