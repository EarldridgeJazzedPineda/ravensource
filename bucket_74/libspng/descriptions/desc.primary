libspng (simple png) is a C library for reading and writing Portable 
Network Graphics (PNG) format files with a focus on security and ease of 
use. It is an alternative to libpng, the projects are separate and the 
APIs are not compatible.

The goal of the project is to provide a fast PNG library with a simpler 
API than libpng, whith outperforms the reference implementation in common 
use cases.
