The libmng library supports decoding, displaying, encoding, and various
other manipulations of Multiple-image Network Graphics (MNG) format image
files.  It uses the zlib(3) compression library, the JPEG library by the
Independent JPEG Group (IJG) and lcms (little CMS), a color-management
library by Marti Maria Saguar.
