The AFDKO is a set of tools for building OpenType font files from
PostScript and TrueType font data.

This release of the Adobe Font Development Kit for OpenType (AFDKO)
contains a set of tools used to make OpenType fonts by adding the
OpenType-specific data to a TrueType or Type1 font. It does not offer
tools for designing or editing glyphs. These command line programs will
allow you to build an OpenType font from an existing font, verify the
contents of the font, and proof the font on screen or on paper.
