Mousepad aims to be an easy-to-use and fast editor. Our target is an 
editor for quickly editing text files, not a development environment or an 
editor with a huge bunch of plugins. On the other hand we try to use the 
latest Gtk+ features available, which means that if Gtk adds something new 
in a major release that is useful for the editor, we will likely bump the 
Gtk dependency and integrate this new feature in Mousepad.
