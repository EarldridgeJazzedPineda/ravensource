Sphinx is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful
documentation for Python projects (or other documents consisting of
multiple reStructuredText sources), written by Georg Brandl. It was
originally created for the new Python documentation, and has excellent
facilities for Python project documentation, but C/C++ is supported as
well, and more languages are planned.

Sphinx uses reStructuredText as its markup language, and many of its
strengths come from the power and straightforwardness of reStructuredText
and its parsing and translating suite, the Docutils.

Among its features are the following:

* Output formats: HTML (including derivative formats such as HTML Help,
Epub  and Qt Help), plain text, manual pages and LaTeX or direct PDF output
 using rst2pdf
* Extensive cross-references: semantic markup and automatic links  for
functions, classes, glossary terms and similar pieces of information
* Hierarchical structure: easy definition of a document tree, with
automatic  links to siblings, parents and children
* Automatic indices: general index as well as a module index
* Code handling: automatic highlighting using the Pygments highlighter
* Flexible HTML output using the Jinja 2 templating engine
* Various extensions are available, e.g. for automatic testing of snippets
and inclusion of appropriately formatted docstrings
* Setuptools integration
