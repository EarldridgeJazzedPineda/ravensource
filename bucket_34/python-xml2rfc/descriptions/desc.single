### Introduction

The [IETF] uses a specific format for the standards and other documents it
publishes as [RFCs], and for the draft documents which are produced when
developing documents for publications. There exists a number of different
tools to facilitate the formatting of drafts and RFCs according to the
existing rules, and this tool, **xml2rfc**, is one of them. It takes as
input an xml file that contains the text and meta-information about author
names etc., and transforms it into suitably formatted output. The input xml
file should follow the grammars in [RFC7749] *(for v2 documents)* or
[RFC7991] *(for v3 documents)*. Note that the grammar for v3 is still being
refined, and changes will eventually be captured in the [bis draft for
7991]. Changes not yet captured can be seen in the xml2rfc source [v3.rng],
or in the [documentation xml2rfc produces] with its `--doc` flag.

**xml2rfc** provides a variety of output formats. See the command line help
for a full list of formats. It also provides conversion from v2 to v3, and
can run the [preptool] on its input.

### Installation

Installation of the python package is done as usual with `pip install
xml2rfc`, using appropriate switches.

#### Installation of support libraries for the PDF-formatter

In order to generate PDFs, **xml2rfc** uses the [WeasyPrint] module, which
depends on external libraries that must be installed as native packages on
your platform, separately from the **xml2rfc** install.

1. First, install the **Pango**, and other required libraries on your
system.  See installation instructions on the [WeasyPrint Docs].

2. Next, install WeasyPrint python modules using pip.

```sh
pip install xml2rfc[pdf]
```
3. Finally, install the required fonts:
  * Download latest fonts from [xml2rfc-fonts].
  * In the **Assets** section, download either the `tar.gz` or the `zip`
archive.
  * Extract the contents of the downloaded `xml2rfc-fonts` archive.
  * Install the fonts found in the `noto` and `roboto_mono` directories to
your operating system.

With these installed and available to **xml2rfc**, the `--pdf` switch will
be enabled.

### Usage

**xml2rfc** accepts a single XML document as input and outputs to one or
more conversion formats.

#### Basic Usage

```sh
xml2rfc SOURCE [options] FORMATS...
```

Run `xml2rfc --help` for a full listing of command-line options.
