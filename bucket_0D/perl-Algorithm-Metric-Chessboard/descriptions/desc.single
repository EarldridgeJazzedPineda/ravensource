Calculates the minimum number of moves between two points in a game played
on a square grid, where one move is a jump from a point to a horizontal,
vertical or diagonal neighbour.  However within the space are "wormholes"
which allow you to travel between any two distant points, so the actual
number of moves may be smaller than the above. Wormhole travel costs a
fixed number of moves.
