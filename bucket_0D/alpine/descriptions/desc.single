ALPINE is a rewrite of the PINE Email and News client with features added 
such as unicode support. It is polular among email power users due to 
being both very configurable and powerful. At the same time Alpine is 
meant to be easy to use, providing detailed context-sensitive help.

There are various popular patches for Alpine, but currently this package
simply provides the MUA as released and without any patches applied.
