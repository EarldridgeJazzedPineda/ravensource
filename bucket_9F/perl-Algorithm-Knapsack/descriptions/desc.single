The knapsack problem asks, given a set of items of various weights, find a
subset or subsets of items such that their total weight is no larger than
some given capacity but as large as possible. This module solves a special
case of the 0-1 knapsack problem when the value of each item is equal to
its weight. Capacity and weights are restricted to positive integers.
