Devilution is a project to re-create and document the source code for the 
game Diablo 1 as closely to the original as possible. It was 
reverse-engineered and cleaned up (believed to be legal under the Digital 
Millennium Copyright Act's documentation and interoperability exceptions).

DevilutionX is a portable version of the engine that uses SDL to run 
across modern operating systems. This package contains just the engine, no 
game data is provided. You will need the original resource container 
("diabdat.mpq") to play.

The Hellfire expansion is also supported since version 1.2.0.
