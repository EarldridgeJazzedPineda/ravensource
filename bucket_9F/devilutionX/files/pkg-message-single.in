NOTE: 64-bit builds of devilutionX are considered experimental right now.
The game is playable but there are major flaws such as morphing potions,
missing features like character deletion, etc.

To play the game it is currently necessary to copy the executable to your 
home directory. Put the diabdat.mpq resource container into the same 
directory and run the game from there.
