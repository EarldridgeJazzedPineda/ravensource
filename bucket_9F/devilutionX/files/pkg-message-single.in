To play the game you need the resource container file DIABDAT.MPQ. Copy
it off your Diablo CD or extract it (using e.g. innoextract) from the
GOG version (see https://www.gog.com/game/diablo). Then put it into the
directory ~/.local/share/diasurgical/devilution and make sure it is
spelled all lower-case!

NOTE: 64-bit builds of devilutionX are considered experimental right now.
The game is playable but there are major flaws such as morphing potions,
missing features like character deletion, etc. These issues are known
and are being addressed upstream.
