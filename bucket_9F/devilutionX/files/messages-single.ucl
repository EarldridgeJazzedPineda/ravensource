To play the game you need the resource container file DIABDAT.MPQ. Copy
it off your Diablo CD or extract it (using e.g. innoextract) from the
GOG version (see https://www.gog.com/game/diablo). Then put it into the
directory ~/.local/share/diasurgical/devilution and make sure it is
spelled all lower-case!

This version matches Diablo 1.9 but also includes some additional fixes
and new features.
