This is a metapackage to install a turnkey Ravenports system.

This package installs a system root and toolchain tailored to the host
platform.  It then ensures that a static version of pkg(8) is available
on the host, and finally it installs the ravenadm administration tool.
At this point the user can use ravenadm to install the latest Ravenports
conspiracy (ports tree consisting of buildsheets) and start building
packages.
