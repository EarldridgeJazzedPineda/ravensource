Xfce4-notifyd is a notification service for the Xfce Desktop that 
implements most of the "server-side" portion of the Freedesktop desktop 
notifications specification. Applications that wish to pop up a 
notification bubble in a standard way can implicitly make use of 
xfce4-notifyd to do so by sending standard messages over D-Bus using the 
org.freedesktop.Notifications interface.
