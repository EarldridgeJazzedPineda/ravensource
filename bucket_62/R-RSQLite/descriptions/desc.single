RSQLite: SQLite Interface for R

Embeds the SQLite database engine in R and provides an interface compliant
with the DBI package. The source for the SQLite engine and for various
extensions in a recent version is included. System libraries will never be
consulted because this package relies on static linking for the plugins it
includes; this also ensures a consistent experience across all
installations.
