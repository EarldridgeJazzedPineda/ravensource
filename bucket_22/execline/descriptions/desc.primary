Execline is a (non-interactive) scripting language, like sh(1) - but its 
syntax is quite different from a traditional shell syntax. The execlineb 
program is meant to be used as an interpreter for a text file; the other 
commands are essentially useful inside an execlineb script.

Execline is as powerful as a shell: it features conditional loops, 
getopt-style option handling, filename globbing, and more. Meanwhile, its 
syntax is far more logic and predictable than the shell's syntax, and has 
no security issues.
