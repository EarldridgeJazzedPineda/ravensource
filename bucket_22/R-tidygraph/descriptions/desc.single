tidygraph: A Tidy API for Graph Manipulation

A graph, while not "tidy" in itself, can be thought of as two tidy data
frames describing node and edge data respectively. 'tidygraph' provides an
approach to manipulate these two virtual data frames using the API defined
in the 'dplyr' package, as well as provides tidy interfaces to a lot of
common graph algorithms.
