This library provides an inotify-compatible interface for applications 
that need to monitor changes happening in a filesystem. It can be useful 
when porting Linux applications which often use the inotify interface.

Libinotify was developed for and tested on NetBSD, OpenBSD and FreeBSD. In 
addition to these systems it was reported to be working on macOS, too.
