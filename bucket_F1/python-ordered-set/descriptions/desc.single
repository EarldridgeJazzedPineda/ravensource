An OrderedSet is a mutable data structure that is a hybrid of a list and a
set.
It remembers the order of its entries, and every entry has an index number
that
can be looked up.

## Installation

`ordered_set` is available on PyPI and packaged as a wheel. You can list it
as a dependency of your project, in whatever form that takes.

To install it into your current Python environment:

    pip install ordered-set

To install the code for development, after checking out the repository:

    pip install flit
    flit install

## Usage examples

An OrderedSet is created and used like a set:

    >>> from ordered_set import OrderedSet

    >>> letters = OrderedSet('abracadabra')

    >>> letters
    OrderedSet(['a', 'b', 'r', 'c', 'd'])

    >>> 'r' in letters
    True

It is efficient to find the index of an entry in an OrderedSet, or find an
entry by its index. To help with this use case, the `.add()` method returns
the index of the added item, whether it was already in the set or not.

    >>> letters.index('r')
    2

    >>> letters[2]
    'r'

    >>> letters.add('r')
    2

    >>> letters.add('x')
    5

OrderedSets implement the union (`|`), intersection (`&`), and difference
(`-`)
operators like sets do.

    >>> letters |= OrderedSet('shazam')

    >>> letters
    OrderedSet(['a', 'b', 'r', 'c', 'd', 'x', 's', 'h', 'z', 'm'])

    >>> letters & set('aeiou')
    OrderedSet(['a'])

    >>> letters -= 'abcd'

    >>> letters
    OrderedSet(['r', 'x', 's', 'h', 'z', 'm'])

The `__getitem__()` and `index()` methods have been extended to accept any
iterable except a string, returning a list, to perform NumPy-like "fancy
indexing".

    >>> letters = OrderedSet('abracadabra')

    >>> letters[[0, 2, 3]]
    ['a', 'r', 'c']

    >>> letters.index(['a', 'r', 'c'])
    [0, 2, 3]

OrderedSet implements `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` so it can be
pickled,
and implements the abstract base classes `collections.MutableSet` and
`collections.Sequence`.

OrderedSet can be used as a generic collection type, similar to the
collections
in the `typing` module like List, Dict, and Set. For example, you can
annotate
a variable as having the type `OrderedSet[str]` or `OrderedSet[Tuple[int,
str]]`.

## OrderedSet in data science applications

An OrderedSet can be used as a bi-directional mapping between a sparse
vocabulary and dense index numbers. As of version 3.1, it accepts NumPy
arrays
of index numbers as well as lists.
