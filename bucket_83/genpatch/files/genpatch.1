.Nd generate patch quickly in standard Ravenports format

.Sh DESCRIPTION    
This utility is always called by
.Xr portfix 1 ,
but quite often it is useful in its own right.

It creates patches using the standard Ravenports format, but there are different
operational modes. If
.Nm
is called when the current working directory is a subdirectory of the
/usr/obj/raven or /construction, then a patch will be saved in the
current directory using the Ravenports naming standard.  Note that the utility
assumes that it has been executed in the WRKSRC directory, the standard location
for applying Ravenports patches.

If
.Nm
is executed outside of those directories, then a patch will not be created.  The 
contents of the patch will be send to stdout, so the user will have to direct it to a
file manually as desired.

If only one argument is given,
.Nm
will search for a file named "<newfile>.intermediate" and if found, it will generated diff
output between it and
.Op newfile .
If that file doesn't exist, it will search for "<newfile>.orig" and attempt to create diff
output between it and
.Op newfile .
.Pp
.Sh ERRORS
.Nm
will abort if no arguments or more than 2 arguments are given.  If only one argument (
.Op newfile
) is given, then a regular file called "<newfile>.orig" or "<newfile>.intermediate"
must exist otherwise
.Nm
will abort.  If two arguments are given, both must be existing regular files.
.Pp
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width "PORTEDITOR" -indent 
.It Ev WORKHERE
Overrides hardcoded /usr/obj/raven and /construction with the current
value of pwd.  This also enables patch generation outside of standard working areas.
.Pp
.It Ev PRINT
Always send the contents of the patch to stdout (never generate a file).
