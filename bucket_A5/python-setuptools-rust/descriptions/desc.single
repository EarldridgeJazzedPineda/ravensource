`setuptools-rust` is a plugin for `setuptools` to build Rust Python
extensions implemented with [PyO3] or [rust-cpython].

Compile and distribute Python extensions written in Rust as easily as if
they were written in C.

## Setup

For a complete example, see
[html-py-ever].

First, you need to create a bunch of files:

### setup.py

```python
from setuptools import setup
from setuptools_rust import Binding, RustExtension

setup(
    name="hello-rust",
    version="1.0",
    rust_extensions=[RustExtension("hello_rust.hello_rust",
binding=Binding.PyO3)],
    packages=["hello_rust"],
    # rust extensions are not zip safe, just like C-extensions.
    zip_safe=False,
)
```

For a complete reference of the options supported by the `RustExtension`
class, see the
[API reference].

### MANIFEST.in

This file is required for building source distributions

```text
include Cargo.toml
recursive-include src *
```

### pyproject.toml

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools", "wheel", "setuptools-rust"]
```

### build-wheels.sh

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -ex

curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- --default-toolchain stable -y
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"

cd /io

for PYBIN in /opt/python/cp{35,36,37,38,39}*/bin; do
    "${PYBIN}/pip" install -U setuptools wheel setuptools-rust
    "${PYBIN}/python" setup.py bdist_wheel
done

for whl in dist/*.whl; do
    auditwheel repair "$whl" -w dist/
done
```

## Usage

You can use same commands as for c-extensions. For example:

```
>>> python ./setup.py develop
running develop
running egg_info
writing hello-rust.egg-info/PKG-INFO
writing top-level names to hello_rust.egg-info/top_level.txt
writing dependency_links to hello_rust.egg-info/dependency_links.txt
reading manifest file 'hello_rust.egg-info/SOURCES.txt'
writing manifest file 'hello_rust.egg-info/SOURCES.txt'
running build_ext
running build_rust
cargo build --manifest-path extensions/Cargo.toml --features python3
