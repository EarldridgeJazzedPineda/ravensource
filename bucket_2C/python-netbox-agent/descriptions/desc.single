# Netbox agent [Build Status]

This project aims to create hardware automatically into [Netbox] based on
standard tools (dmidecode, lldpd, parsing /sys/, etc).

The goal is to generate an existing infrastructure on Netbox and have the
ability to update it regularly by executing the agent.

# Features

* Create virtual machines, servers, chassis and blade through standard
tools (`dmidecode`)
* Create physical, bonding and vlan network interfaces with IPs (IPv4 &
IPv6)
* Create IPMI interface if found
* Create or get existing VLAN and associate it to interfaces
* Generic ability to guess datacenters and rack location through drivers
(`cmd` and `file` and custom ones)
* Update existing `Device` and `Interface`
* Handle blade moving (new slot, new chassis)
* Handle blade GPU expansions
* Automatic cabling (server's interface to switch's interface) using lldp
* Local inventory using `Inventory Item` for CPU, GPU, RAM, RAID cards,
physical disks (behind raid cards)
* PSUs creation and power consumption reporting (based on vendor's tools)

# Requirements

- Netbox >= 3.7
- Python >= 3.7
- [pynetbox]
- [python3-netaddr]
- [python3-netifaces]
- [jsonargparse]

- ethtool
- dmidecode
- ipmitool
- lldpd
- lshw

## Inventory requirement
- hpassacli
- storcli
- omreport

# Installation

```
# pip3 install netbox-agent
```

# Usage

The agent can be run from a shell and get its configuration from either the
configuration file or environment variables.

Configuration values are overridden based on the following precedence:
command line arguments (might include config file) > environment variables
> default config file > defaults.

If you need, you can update only specific informations like:
* Network
* Inventory
* Location
* PSUs

```
# ip a add 42.42.42.43/24 dev enp1s0f1
# netbox_agent -c /etc/netbox_agent.yaml --update-network
