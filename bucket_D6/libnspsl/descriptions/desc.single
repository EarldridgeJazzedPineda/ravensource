Library to generate static code representation of the Public suffix list.

The public suffix list is a database of top level domain names. The 
database allows an application to determine if a domain name requires an 
additional label to be valid.

The principle useed in web browsers is to restrict supercookies being set 
although it can also serve secondary purposes in the UI such as domain 
highlighting.
