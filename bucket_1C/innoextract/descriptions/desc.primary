Inno Setup is a tool to create installers for Microsoft Windows 
applications. innoextract allows to extract such installers without 
running the actual setup executable under Windows or using Wine.

In addition to standard Inno Setup installers, innoextract also supports 
some modified Inno Setup variants like GOG.com installers.
