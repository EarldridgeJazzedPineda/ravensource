C library providing BLAKE2b, BLAKE2s, BLAKE2bp, BLAKE2sp

BLAKE2 is a cryptographic hash function faster than MD5, SHA-1, SHA-2, and
SHA-3, yet is at least as secure as the latest standard SHA-3.

BLAKE2 comes in two flavors:
  * BLAKE2b (or just BLAKE2) is optimized for 64-bit platforms - including
    NEON-enabled ARMs - and produces digests sized between 1 and 64 bytes
  * BLAKE2s is optimized for 8- to 32-bit platforms and produces digests
    sized between 1 and 32 bytes
