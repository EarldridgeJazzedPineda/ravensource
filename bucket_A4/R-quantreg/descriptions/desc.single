quantreg: Quantile Regression

Estimation and inference methods for models of conditional quantiles:
Linear and nonlinear parametric and non-parametric (total variation
penalized) models for conditional quantiles of a univariate response and
several methods for handling censored survival data. Portfolio selection
methods based on expected shortfall risk are also now included. See Koenker
