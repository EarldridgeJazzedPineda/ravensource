Changelog
---------

20.4 - 2020-05-19
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Canonicalize version before comparing specifiers. (`#282
<https://github.com/pypa/packaging/issues/282>`__)
* Change type hint for canonicalize_name to return
  ``packaging.utils.NormalizedName``.
  This enables the use of static typing tools (like mypy) to detect mixing
of
  normalized and un-normalized names.

20.3 - 2020-03-05
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fix changelog for 20.2.

20.2 - 2020-03-05
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fix a bug that caused a 32-bit OS that runs on a 64-bit ARM CPU (e.g.
ARM-v8,
  aarch64), to report the wrong bitness.

20.1 - 2020-01-24
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fix a bug caused by reuse of an exhausted iterator. (`#257
<https://github.com/pypa/packaging/issues/257>`__)
