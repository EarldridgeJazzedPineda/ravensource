QQC2-Desktop-Style is a style for Qt Quick Controls 2 (QQC2) which uses
QStyle to paint the controls in order to give them native look and feel.

This framework has no public API, applications should not (and can not)
use it directly. Instead, developers should add this framework as a
dependency of their desktop apps.
