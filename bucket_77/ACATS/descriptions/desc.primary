This package contains the continuation of development of the
Ada Conformity Assessment Test Suite customized for use with the FSF GCC
compiler.  It has been further customized to test some of the gcc
compilers contained within Ravenports.

The following scripts have been added to /raven/bin:

  acats_test_ravensys  (for testing ravensys-gcc)
  acats_test_gcc10     (for testing gcc10)
  acats_test_gcc11     (for testing gcc11)
  acats_test_gcc12     (for testing gcc12)

By default, the results of these tests are placed at $HOME/ACATS_results .
If ACATS_RESULT_DIR is defined in the environment, this location will
be used instead.
