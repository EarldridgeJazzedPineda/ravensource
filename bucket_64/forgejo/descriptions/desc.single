Forgejo is a self-hosted lightweight software forge written in Go. Easy to 
install and low maintenance, it just does the job if you're looking for an 
alternative to GitHub.

It is currently a "soft" fork of Gitea which is a fork of Gogs. Forgejo 
was started by members of the Gitea community who were unhappy that the 
leaders founded a for-profit company and acted rather intransparently in 
that regard. Other than being guaranteed to always remain Free Software, 
it puts its focus on scaling, federation and privacy.
