Ytnef decodes application/ms-tnef MIME attachments that Microsoft mail 
servers use to encapsulate already MIME encoded attachments.

The program allows for unpacking attachments which are encapsulated into 
an tnef attachment, thus alleviating the need to use Microsoft Outlook to 
view them. It also supports winmail.dat Outlook files.
