sf: Simple Features for R

Support for simple features, a standardized way to encode spatial vector
data. Binds to 'GDAL' for reading and writing data, to 'GEOS' for
geometrical operations, and to 'PROJ' for projection conversions and datum
transformations. Uses by default the 's2' package for spherical geometry
operations on ellipsoidal (long/lat) coordinates.
