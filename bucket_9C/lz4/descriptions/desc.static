LZ4 is a very fast lossless compression algorithm, providing compression
speed at 400 MB/s per core, scalable with multi-cores CPU. It also features
an extremely fast decoder, with speed in multiple GB/s per core, typically
reaching RAM speed limits on multi-core systems.

A high compression derivative, called LZ4_HC, is also provided. It trades
CPU time for compression ratio.

This package contains the static library and headers.
