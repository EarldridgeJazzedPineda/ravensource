Combinatorics is the branch of mathematics studying the enumeration,
combination, and permutation of sets of elements and the mathematical
relations that characterize their properties. This module provides a
pure-perl implementation of nCk, nCRk, nPk, nPRk, !n and n! (combination,
multiset, permutation, string, derangement, and factorial, respectively).
