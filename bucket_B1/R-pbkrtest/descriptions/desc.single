pbkrtest: Parametric Bootstrap and Kenward Roger Based Methods for
MixedModel Comparison

Test in mixed effects models. Attention is on mixed effects models as
implemented in the 'lme4' package. This package implements a parametric
bootstrap test and a Kenward Roger modification of F-tests for linear mixed
effects models and a parametric bootstrap test for generalized linear mixed
models.
