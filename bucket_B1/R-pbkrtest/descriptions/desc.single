Test in mixed effects models. Attention is on mixed effects models
    as implemented in the 'lme4' package. This package implements a
parametric
    bootstrap test and a Kenward Roger modification of F-tests for linear
mixed
    effects models and a parametric bootstrap test for generalized linear
mixed
    models.
