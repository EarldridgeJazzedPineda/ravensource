Leatherman - a C++ toolkit

Leatherman can be used in one of two ways: It can be installed as a regular
library, and included using the normal CMake find_package syntax, or it can
be setup as a submodule. The recommended method is to install Leatherman
and use it as a regular system library.

Leatherman is broken up into a number of focused component libraries. Both
methods of using Leatherman allow you to control which components are built
and used.
