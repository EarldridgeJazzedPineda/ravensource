HIDAPI is a multi-platform library which allows an application to 
interface with USB and Bluetooth HID-Class devices on Windows, Linux, 
FreeBSD and macOS.

It can be built either as a shared library or can be embedded directly 
into a target application by adding a single source file (per platform) 
and a single header.
