Glade is a RAD tool to enable quick & easy development of user interfaces 
for the GTK toolkit and the GNOME desktop environment.

The user interfaces designed in Glade are saved as XML, and by using 
GtkBuilder GTK object these can be loaded by applications dynamically as 
needed.

By using GtkBuilder, Glade XML files can be used in numerous programming 
languages including C, C++, C#, Vala, Java, Perl, Python, and others.
