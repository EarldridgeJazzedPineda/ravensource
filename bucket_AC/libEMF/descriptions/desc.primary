libEMF is a C/C++ library for generating Enhanced Metafiles on systems 
which don't natively support the ECMA-234 Graphics Interface (GDI). The 
library is intended to be used as a driver for other graphic programs such 
as Grace or gnuplot. Therefore, it implements a very limited subset of the 
GDI.
