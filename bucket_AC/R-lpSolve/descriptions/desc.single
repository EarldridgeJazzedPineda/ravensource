lpSolve: Interface to 'Lp_solve' v. 5.5 to Solve Linear/Integer Programs

Lp_solve is freely available (under LGPL 2) software for solving linear,
integer and mixed integer programs. In this implementation we supply a
"wrapper" function in C and some R functions that solve general
linear/integer problems, assignment problems, and transportation problems.
This version calls lp_solve version 5.5.
