This package contains a copy of [Google's i18n
address] metadata repository
that contains great data but comes with no uptime guarantees.

Contents of this package will allow you to programatically build address
forms that adhere to rules of a particular region or country, validate
local addresses and format them to produce a valid address label for
delivery.

The package also contains a Python interface for address validation.

Addresses validation
--------------------

The normalize_address function checks the address and either returns its
canonical form (suitable for storage and use in addressing envelopes) or
raises an InvalidAddress exception that contains a list of errors.
