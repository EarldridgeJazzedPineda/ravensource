The pkg-config program retrieves information about installed libraries,
usually for the purposes of compiling against and linking to them. This
module is a very simplistic interface to pkg-config, intended for use in
the Makefile.PL of perl extensions which bind libraries that pkg-config
knows. It is really just boilerplate code that you would've written
yourself.
