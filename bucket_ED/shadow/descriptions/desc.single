Password and account management tool suite with support for shadow files
and PAM (Linux only).

Initially used to obtain User and Group addition tools for the Linux
system root for Ravenadm.  Thus all the options are intentionally turned
off.  Should this package be desired in its own right, the shadow port
can be split into variants to satisfy ravenadm and real users.
