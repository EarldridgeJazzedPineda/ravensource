NetDoc is an automatic network documentation plugin for NetBox. NetDoc aims
to discover a partially known network populating netbox and drawing L2 and
L3 diagrams.

NetDoc discovers, via nornir+netmiko, network devices fetching information
(routing, adjacencies, configuration...).

NetDoc populates netbox (devices, cables, IPAM).
