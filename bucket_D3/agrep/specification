# I have no freakin' idea why Debian and others distribute the ancient
# version 2.04 as 4.17! There is no such thing.
# Nixpackages has a version 3.41.5 that does exist but is fetched from
# GitHub as it was never formally released.

# This version is based on AGREP from GLIMPSE 3.0 and was further improved and
# had bugs fixed. The original code was free for personal use but property of
# the University of Arizona. The author of this version successfully asked for
# re-licensing and the University of Arizona Office of Technology Transfer and
# all the original developers chose to re-license the code under the ISC
# license. However no new version was released afterwards.
# So this is the latest release with the license updated.
