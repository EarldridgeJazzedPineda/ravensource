Grand Central Dispatch (GCD or libdispatch) provides comprehensive support
for concurrent code execution on multicore hardware.

libdispatch is currently available on Darwin and Linux platforms. This
project aims to make a modern version of libdispatch available on all
other Swift platforms. To do this, we will implement as much of the
portable subset of the API as possible, using the existing open source C
implementation.
