This package contains a set of C++ libraries for multimedia streaming, 
using open standard protocols (RTP/RTCP, RTSP, SIP). They can be used to 
build streaming applications. These libraries can also be used to stream, 
receive, and process MPEG, H.265, H.264, H.263+, DV or JPEG video, and 
several audio codecs. They can easily be extended to support additional 
(audio and/or video) codecs, and can also be used to build basic RTSP or 
SIP clients and servers.
