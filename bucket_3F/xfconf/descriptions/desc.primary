Xfconf is a hierarchical (tree-like) configuration system where the 
immediate child nodes of the root are called "channels". All settings 
beneath the channel nodes are called "properties." 

Settings stored in Xfconf can be accessed in numerous ways:

 -   From within applications of Settings Manager
 -   From Command Line Interface (CLI) using xfconf-query
 -   From GUI
 -   If everything else fails, settings can be edited manually
