libmemcached-awesome is an open source C/C++ client library and tools for 
the memcached server (http://memcached.org/). It has been designed to be 
light on memory usage, thread safe, and provide full access to server side 
methods. It is a resurrection of the original work from Brian Aker at 
libmemcached.org.
