deldir: Delaunay Triangulation and Dirichlet (Voronoi) Tessellation

Calculates the Delaunay triangulation and the Dirichlet or Voronoi
tessellation (with respect to the entire plane) of a planar point set.
Plots triangulations and tessellations in various ways. Clips tessellations
to sub-windows. Calculates perimeters of tessellations. Summarises
information about the tiles of the tessellation.
