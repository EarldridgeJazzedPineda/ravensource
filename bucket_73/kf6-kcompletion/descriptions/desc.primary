When typing filenames, email addresses and other text where the user often 
wants to select from existing data (including previously typed text) 
rather than enter anything wholly original, users often find it helpful if 
the only need to type the first few characters and then have the 
application offer them a set of choices or attempt to autocomplete what 
they were typing. Email clients, shells and "open file" dialogs often 
provide this functionality.
