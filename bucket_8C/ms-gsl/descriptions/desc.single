The Guidelines Support Library (GSL) contains functions and types that are 
suggested for use by the C++ Core Guidelines maintained by the Standard 
C++ Foundation. This repo contains Microsoft's implementation of GSL.

The entire implementation is provided inline in the headers under the gsl 
directory. The implementation generally assumes a platform that implements 
C++14 support.
