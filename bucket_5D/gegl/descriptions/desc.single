The Generic Graphics Library (GEGL) is a graph based image processing
framework.

GEGL provides infrastructure to do demand-based cached non-destructive
image editing on larger than RAM buffers. Through the babl library it
provides support for a wide range of color models and pixel storage
formats for input and output.
