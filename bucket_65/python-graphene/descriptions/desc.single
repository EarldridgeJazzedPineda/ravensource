Introduction
------------

[Graphene] is an opinionated Python
library for building GraphQL schemas/types fast and easily.

-  **Easy to use:** Graphene helps you use GraphQL in Python without
   effort.
-  **Relay:** Graphene has builtin support for Relay.
-  **Data agnostic:** Graphene supports any kind of data source: SQL
   (Django, SQLAlchemy), NoSQL, custom Python objects, etc. We believe
   that by providing a complete API you could plug Graphene anywhere
   your data lives and make your data available through GraphQL.

Integrations
------------

Graphene has multiple integrations with different frameworks:

| Django            | `graphene-django <https:/                       |
|                   | /github.com/graphql-python/graphene-django/>`__ |
+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| SQLAlchemy        | `graphene-sqlalchemy <https://git               |
|                   | hub.com/graphql-python/graphene-sqlalchemy/>`__ |
+-------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| Google App Engine | `graphene-gae <http                             |
|                   | s://github.com/graphql-python/graphene-gae/>`__ |

Also, Graphene is fully compatible with the GraphQL spec, working
seamlessly with all GraphQL clients, such as
[Relay],
[Apollo] and
[gql].
