## Introduction

[Graphene] is an opinionated Python library for building GraphQL
schemas/types fast and easily.

- **Easy to use:** Graphene helps you use GraphQL in Python without effort.
- **Relay:** Graphene has builtin support for Relay.
- **Data agnostic:** Graphene supports any kind of data source: SQL
(Django, SQLAlchemy), Mongo, custom Python objects, etc.
  We believe that by providing a complete API you could plug Graphene
anywhere your data lives and make your data available
  through GraphQL.

## Integrations

Graphene has multiple integrations with different frameworks:

| integration       | Package                                              
                                  |
| ----------------- |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| SQLAlchemy        | [graphene-sqlalchemy]           |
| Mongo             | [graphene-mongo]                     |
| Apollo Federation | [graphene-federation]           |
| Django            | [graphene-django]                   |

Also, Graphene is fully compatible with the GraphQL spec, working
seamlessly with all GraphQL clients, such as [Relay], [Apollo] and [gql].

## Installation

To install `graphene`, just run this command in your shell

```bash
pip install "graphene>=3.1"
```

## Examples

Here is one example for you to get started:

```python
import graphene

class Query(graphene.ObjectType):
    hello = graphene.String(description='A typical hello world')

    def resolve_hello(self, info):
        return 'World'

schema = graphene.Schema(query=Query)
```

Then Querying `graphene.Schema` is as simple as:

```python
query = '''
    query SayHello {
      hello
    }
'''
result = schema.execute(query)
```

## Contributing

After cloning this repo, create a [virtualenv] and ensure dependencies are
installed by running:

```sh
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[test]"
```

Well-written tests and maintaining good test coverage is important to this
project. While developing, run new and existing tests with:

```sh
pytest graphene/relay/tests/test_node.py # Single file
