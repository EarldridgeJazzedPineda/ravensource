Installation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Exhale is a `Sphinx Extension`__ that depends on `Breathe`_ for access to
the Doxygen
reStructuredText directives, and both `BeautifulSoup`_ and `lxml`_ for
parsing the
generated Doxygen XML documentation.  Exhale is [hosted on PyPI
], meaning you can install it through the normal
mechanisms, e.g.,

__ http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/extensions.html

.. _BeautifulSoup: https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/
.. _lxml: http://lxml.de/
.. _Breathe: https://breathe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

.. code-block:: console

   $ python -m pip install exhale

This will install Exhale, as well as all of its dependencies.

For your project's documentation requirements, adopting ``exhale@0.3.0
means you just
need to specify directly that your docs/requirements.txt`` or similar
express::

    exhale>=0.3.0

The ``exhale@0.3.0 release uses the same dependencies required by
breathe@4.32.0``.
If you need python 3.5 support, pin your documentation requirements to::

    sphinx>=2.0
    breathe>=4.13.0
    exhale<0.3.0

For Python 2.7, you should pin your documentation requirements to::

    sphinx==1.8.5
    breathe==4.12.0
    exhale<0.3.0

**Order matters**, namely that sphinx and breathe appear / are installed
before
exhale.  Exhale 0.2.* releases support Python 2.7, but users need to be
aware of the
dependencies between Python, Sphinx, and Breathe versions.

This project could not exist without the already excellent tools available:
Doxygen,
Sphinx, Breathe, and many others.  In particular, though, for the Tree View
hierarchies
to be successful, I vendor copies of two excellent libraries that I make no
claims to.
They are vendored with your installation of Exhale, in accordance with each
project's
license:

1. For non-bootstrap, I used Kate Morley's excellent and lightweight
collapsibleLists_
   including the sample CSS / images on that post.  She includes a generous
   `CC0 1.0 license <http://code.iamkate.com/>`_ for these files, as well
as the rest of
   her website.

   For every HTML Theme I have tried, except for ones using bootstrap, this
library
   works reliably and consistently.  It matches the Sphinx RTD theme quite
well, too!

2. For bootstrap, I used Jon Miles' comprehensive `bootstrap-treeview`__
library.  Jon
   Miles hosts this library using the
   [Apache v2 license].
