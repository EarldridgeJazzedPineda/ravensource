This is bzip2, a advanced block-sorting file compressor.  It is believed
to be free from any patents.  bzip2 compresses files using the
Burrows-Wheeler block sorting text compression algorithm, and Huffman
coding. Compression is generally considerably better than that achieved
by more conventional LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the
performance of the PPM family of statistical compressors.

This package contains the shared bzip2 shared library.
