Grep is a command-line utility for searching plain-text data sets for
lines that match a regular expression. Its name comes from the ed
command g/re/p (globally search a regular expression and print),
which has the same effect: doing a global search with the regular
expression and printing all matching lines. Grep was originally
developed for the Unix operating system, but later available for all
Unix-like systems.

This package contains the GNU implementation of grep.
