Pleaserun is a tool to generate startup scripts and service definitions. It
targets service managers such as systemd, Upstart, launchd, sysv init, and
runit.

Ideally, you should be able to specify a configuration of how to run a
given service command (like apache, syslog-ng, whatever), and this tool
should be able to spit out a script or config file for your target
platform.
