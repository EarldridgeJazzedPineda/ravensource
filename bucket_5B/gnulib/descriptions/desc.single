Gnulib is a central location for common GNU code, intended to be shared 
among GNU packages. GCC has libiberty, but this is hard to disentangle 
from the GCC build tree.

Gnulib takes a different approach. Its components are intended to be 
shared at the source level, rather than being a library that gets built, 
installed, and linked against.
