This is just the game engine which cannot be used without game data.
If you own any full version of the supported games, put the WAD
(resource container) files into /raven/share/games/doomengine so that
chocolate-doom will find them.

If you do not have any retail IWAD, have a look at the doomgame-iwad
package. The shareware / demo versions of the games as well as some
fan-made free games are available.
