BIND is open source software that enables you to publish your Domain Name 
System (DNS) information on the Internet, and to resolve DNS queries for 
your users.  The name BIND stands for "Berkeley Internet Name Domain", 
because the software originated in the early 1980s at the University of 
California at Berkeley.

This package contains the BIND tools.
