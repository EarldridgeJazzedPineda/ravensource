The Mesa project began as an open-source implementation of the OpenGL
specification - a system for rendering interactive 3D graphics.

Over the years the project has grown to implement more graphics APIs,
including OpenGL ES (versions 1, 2, 3), OpenCL, OpenMAX, VDPAU, VA API,
XvMC and Vulkan.

A variety of device drivers allows the Mesa libraries to be used in many
different environments ranging from software emulation to complete
hardware acceleration for modern GPUs.

Mesa ties into several other open-source projects: the Direct Rendering
Infrastructure and X.org to provide OpenGL support on Linux, FreeBSD
and other operating systems.

This package contains the Mesa OpenGL libraries for GLX and EGL clients.
These include libOSMesa, libEGL, libGL, and libglesv2 as well as utility
libraries libglapi and gbm.  The OSMesa library is an Off-Screen version
of Mesa in order to do off-screen rendering in other packages like VTK.
Offscreen rendering is useful for a number of things, such as batch
processing, parallel processing, and remote processing.

This package also contains Mesa's libOpenCL implementation "Clover".  It is
built upon GALLIUM and currently only supports Radeon GPUs.
