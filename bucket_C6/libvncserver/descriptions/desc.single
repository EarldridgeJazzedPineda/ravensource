LibVNCServer/LibVNCClient are cross-platform C libraries that allow you to
easily implement Virtual Network Computing (VNC) server or client
functionality in programs.

In computing, Virtual Network Computing is a graphical desktop-sharing
system that uses the Remote Frame Buffer protocol (RFB) to remotely
control another computer. It transmits the keyboard and mouse events from
one computer to another, relaying the graphical-screen updates back in the
other direction, over a network.
