## Features

In addition to an ASN.1 BER/DER decoder and DER serializer, the project
includes
a bunch of ASN.1 structures for use with various common cryptography
standards:

## Why Another Python ASN.1 Library?

Python has long had the [pyasn1] and
[pyasn1_modules] available for
parsing and serializing ASN.1 structures. While the project does include a
comprehensive set of tools for parsing and serializing, the performance of
the
library can be very poor, especially when dealing with bit fields and
parsing
large structures such as CRLs.

After spending extensive time using *pyasn1*, the following issues were
identified:

 1. Poor performance
 2. Verbose, non-pythonic API
 3. Out-dated and incomplete definitions in *pyasn1-modules*
 4. No simple way to map data to native Python data structures
 5. No mechanism for overridden universal ASN.1 types

The *pyasn1* API is largely method driven, and uses extensive configuration
objects and lowerCamelCase names. There were no consistent options for
converting types of native Python data structures. Since the project
supports
out-dated versions of Python, many newer language features are unavailable
for use.

Time was spent trying to profile issues with the performance, however the
architecture made it hard to pin down the primary source of the poor
performance. Attempts were made to improve performance by utilizing
unreleased
patches and delaying parsing using the `Any` type. Even with such changes,
the
performance was still unacceptably slow.
