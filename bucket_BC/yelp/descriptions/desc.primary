Yelp is the help viewer in GNOME. It natively views Mallard, DocBook, man, 
info, and HTML documents. It can locate documents according to the 
freedesktop.org help system specification.

Yelp development has led to the development of various tools, and the 
Mallard and DocBook transformations live in standalone XSLT module. All of 
these are under the umbrella name Yelp.
