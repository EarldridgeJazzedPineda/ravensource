libjpeg-turbo is a high-speed version of libjpeg for x86 and x86-64
processors which uses SIMD instructions (MMX, SSE2, etc.) to accelerate
baseline JPEG compression and decompression.  libjpeg-turbo is generally
2-4x as fast as the unmodified version of libjpeg, all else being equal.

This package contains command line tools that use the library.
