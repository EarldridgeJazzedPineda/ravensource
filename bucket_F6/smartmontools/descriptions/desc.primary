Smartmontools provides two programs, smartctl and the smartd daemon. They are used to control and monitor storage devices using the S.M.A.R.T (Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology) system supported by most modern ATA/SATA, SCSI/SAS and NVMe disks. It is commonly used to provide early warnings before your storage devices fail.
