This module implements a single feature only of interest to advanced perl
modules, namely asynchronous interruptions (think "UNIX signals", which are
very similar).  It implements asynchronous notifications that enable you to
signal running perl code from another thread, asynchronously, and sometimes
even without using a single syscall.
