This package is intended to be independently reusable in any Python
project. It is maintained by the [Zope Toolkit project
].

This package provides an implementation of "object interfaces" for Python.
Interfaces are a mechanism for labeling objects as conforming to a given
API or contract. So, this package can be considered as implementation of
the `Design By Contract`_ methodology support in Python.

 Changes
=========

5.5.1 (2022-11-03)
==================

- Add support for final Python 3.11 release.

5.5.0 (2022-10-10)
==================

- Add support for Python 3.10 and 3.11 (as of 3.11.0rc2).

- Add missing Trove classifier showing support for Python 3.9.

- Add some more entries to ``zope.interface.interfaces.__all__``.

- Disable unsafe math optimizations in C code.  See [pull request 262
 ].

5.4.0 (2021-04-15)
==================

- Make the C implementation of the __providedBy__ descriptor stop
  ignoring all errors raised when accessing the instance's
  __provides__. Now it behaves like the Python version and only
  catches AttributeError. The previous behaviour could lead to
  crashing the interpreter in cases of recursion and errors. See
  [issue 239].

- Update the ``repr() and str()`` of various objects to be shorter
  and more informative. In many cases, the ``repr()`` is now something
  that can be evaluated to produce an equal object. For example, what
  was previously printed as ``<implementedBy builtins.list> is now
  shown as classImplements(list, IMutableSequence, IIterable)``. See
  [issue 236].

- Make ``Declaration.__add__`` (as in ``implementedBy(Cls) +
  ISomething``) try harder to preserve a consistent resolution order
  when the two arguments share overlapping pieces of the interface
  inheritance hierarchy. Previously, the right hand side was always
  put at the end of the resolution order, which could easily produce
  invalid orders. See [issue 193
 ].

5.3.0 (2020-03-21)
==================

- No changes from 5.3.0a1

5.3.0a1 (2021-03-18)
====================

- Improve the repr of ``zope.interface.Provides`` to remove ambiguity
  about what is being provided. This is especially helpful diagnosing
  IRO issues.

- Allow subclasses of BaseAdapterRegistry (including
  AdapterRegistry and VerifyingAdapterRegistry) to have
  control over the data structures. This allows persistent
  implementations such as those based on ZODB to choose more scalable
  options (e.g., BTrees instead of dicts). See [issue 224
 ].

- Fix a reference counting issue in BaseAdapterRegistry that could
  lead to references to interfaces being kept around even when all
  utilities/adapters/subscribers providing that interface have been
  removed. This is mostly an issue for persistent implementations.
  Note that this only corrects the issue moving forward, it does not
  solve any already corrupted reference counts. See [issue 227
 ].

- Add the method ``BaseAdapterRegistry.rebuild()``. This can be used
  to fix the reference counting issue mentioned above, as well as to
  update the data structures when custom data types have changed.
