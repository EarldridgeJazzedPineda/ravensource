## Intro</a>

Tomli is a Python library for parsing [TOML].
It is fully compatible with [TOML v1.0.0].

A version of Tomli, the `tomllib` module,
was added to the standard library in Python 3.11
via [PEP 680].
Tomli continues to provide a backport on PyPI for Python versions
where the standard library module is not available
and that have not yet reached their end-of-life.

## Installation<a name="installation">

`bash
pip install tomli
`

## Usage</a>

### Parse a TOML string<a name="parse-a-toml-string">

```python
import tomli

toml_str = """
[[players]]
name = "Lehtinen"
number = 26

[[players]]
name = "Numminen"
number = 27
"""

toml_dict = tomli.loads(toml_str)
assert toml_dict == {
    "players": [{"name": "Lehtinen", "number": 26}, {"name": "Numminen",
"number": 27}]
}
```

### Parse a TOML file</a>

```python
import tomli

with open("path_to_file/conf.toml", "rb") as f:
    toml_dict = tomli.load(f)
```

The file must be opened in binary mode (with the `"rb"` flag).
Binary mode will enforce decoding the file as UTF-8 with universal newlines
disabled,
both of which are required to correctly parse TOML.

### Handle invalid TOML<a name="handle-invalid-toml">

```python
import tomli

try:
    toml_dict = tomli.loads("]] this is invalid TOML [[")
except tomli.TOMLDecodeError:
    print("Yep, definitely not valid.")
```

Note that error messages are considered informational only.
They should not be assumed to stay constant across Tomli versions.

### Construct `decimal.Decimal`s from TOML floats</a>
