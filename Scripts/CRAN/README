This directory contains the R module generator.

It works recursively -- meaning when provided the name of a module to
generate, it will generate all the dependencies of that module, and
their dependencies, etc.

It will accept arguments as names of R ports to build.
If given no arguments, it will use contents of the list.top-level-R-ports
file as its build list.

.e.g.	./regenerate_R_ports.php caret learnr
	./regenerate_R_ports.php

Files to augment over time:
list.top-level-R-ports		Main R ports wanted in Ravenports
list.dead-homepage		List of R modules with homepage urls
				that don't resolve
list.https-redirect		List of http:// urls that have permanent
				redirects to https
list.description-override	Keyed table: R module => new description
				(use '\n' to indicate newlines).
list.summary-override		Keyed table: R module => new summary
				(limited to 50 characters)
