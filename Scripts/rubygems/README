This directory contains the rubygem generator.

It works recursively -- meaning when provided the name of a module to
generate, it will generate all the dependencies of that module, and
their dependencies, etc.

It will accept arguments as names of ruby ports to build.
If given no arguments, it will use contents of the list.top-level-gems
file as its build list.

.e.g.	./regenerate_rubygems.php hashie crass
	./regenerate_rubygems.php

If the switch "--force" is provided, the script will ignore any cached
files and refetch (and overwrite if it has too).

Files to augment over time:
list.top-level-gems		Main rubygems wanted in Ravenports
list.dead-homepage		List of rubygems with homepage urls
				that don't resolve
list.https-redirect		List of http:// urls that have permanent
				redirects to https
list.description-override	Keyed table: gem => new description
				(use '\n' to indicate newlines).
list.summary-override		Keyed table: gem => new summary
				(limited to 50 characters)
list.version-override		Keyed table: gem => specified version


RubyGem central site:
https://rubygems.org/

Customization:
The generator only produces the specification file, the distinfo file, and
the descriptions/desc.single file.  Maintainers must add the patches,
files, <opsys> directories as needed.  If there is no manifests directory,
the "USES=gem" module will automatically create a manifest.

If there is a specification.manual file in the port's directory, it will be
concatenated to the end of the generated specification.

Misc: command to remove trailing whitespace  
perl -pi -e 's,[ \t]+$,,' <filename>
