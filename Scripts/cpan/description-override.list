perl-EV	This is a perl interface to libev, a high performance full-featured event loop.
perl-AnyEvent	The DBI of event loop programming - EV, Event, Glib, Tk, UV, Perl, Event::Lib, Irssi, rxvt-unicode, IO::Async, Qt, FLTK and POE are various supported event loops/environments.
perl-Clone-PP	This module provides a general-purpose clone function to make deep copies of Perl data structures. It calls itself recursively to copy nested hash, array, scalar and reference types, including tied variables and objects.
perl-enum	This module is used to efine a set of symbolic constants with ordered numeric values similar to enum types in the C programming language.
perl-Graph	This is Graph, a Perl module for dealing with graphs, the abstract data structures.  (If you were looking for pie charts, I'm sorry.)
perl-Guard	This module implements so-called "guards". A guard is something (usually an object) that "guards" a resource, ensuring that it is cleaned up when expected.  Specifically, this module supports two different types of guards: guard objects, which execute a given code block when destroyed, and scoped guards, which are tied to the scope exit.
perl-JSON-XS	This module converts Perl data structures to JSON and vice versa. Its primary goal is to be *correct* and its secondary goal is to be *fast*. To reach the latter goal it was written in C.
perl-Math-Big	This module contains routines (cos,sin,primes,hailstone,euler,fibbonaci etc) with big numbers.
perl-PadWalker	PadWalker is a module which allows you to inspect (and even change!) lexical variables in any subroutine which called it. It will only show those variables which are in scope at the point of the call.
perl-Set-Scalar	The first priority of Set::Scalar is to be a convenient interface to sets (as in: unordered colletions of Perl scalars.)  While not designed to be slow or big, neither has it been designed to be fast or compact.
perl-Test-Deep	This module gives you lots of flexibility when testing deep structures.
perl-Test-Most	This module contains the most commonly needed test functions and features.
perl-TimeDate	The parser contained here will only parse absolute dates.  If you want a date parser that can parse relative dates then take a look at the Time modules by David Muir on CPAN.
perl-XML-SAX	This module consists of several framework classes for using and building Perl SAX2 XML parsers, filters, and drivers. It is designed around the need to be able to "plug in" different SAX parsers to an application without requiring programmer intervention.
perl-Algorithm-Diff	This is a module for computing the difference between two files, two strings, or any other two lists of things.  It uses an intelligent algorithm similar to (or identical to) the one used by the Unix "diff" program.  It is guaranteed to find the *smallest possible* set of differences.
perl-Algorithm-FEC	This is a module for performing Forward Error Correction using Vandermonde Matrices.
perl-Algorithm-Loops	This module provides several functions for doing different types of looping constructs: Filter, MapCar, MapCarU, MapCarE, MapCarMin, NextPermute, NextPermuteNum, and NestedLoops
perl-AnyEvent-HTTP	This module implements a simple, stateless and non-blocking HTTP client. It supports GET, POST and other request methods, cookies and more, all on a very low level. It can follow redirects, supports proxies, and automatically limits the number of connections to the values specified in the RFC.
perl-Astro-FITS-CFITSIO	Astro::FITS::CFITSIO is a Perl interface to William Pence's cfitsio subroutine library. For more information on cfitsio, see http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio .
perl-Async-Interrupt	This module implements a single feature only of interest to advanced perl modules, namely asynchronous interruptions (think "UNIX signals", which are very similar).  It implements asynchronous notifications that enable you to signal running perl code from another thread, asynchronously, and sometimes even without using a single syscall.
perl-Canary-Stability	This module is used by Schmorp's modules during configuration stage to test the installed perl for compatibility with his modules.
perl-Class-Accessor	This module automagically generates accessors/mutators for your class.
perl-common-sense	This module implements some sane defaults for Perl programs, as defined by two typical (or not so typical - use your common sense) specimens of Perl coders. In fact, after working out details on which warnings and strict modes to enable and make fatal, we found that we (and our code written so far, and others) fully agree on every option, even though we never used warnings before, so it seems this module indeed reflects a "common" sense among some long-time Perl coders.
perl-Config-General	This module opens a config file and parses it's contents for you. After parsing the module returns a hash structure which contains the representation of the config file.
perl-Devel-CheckLib	This module provides a way of checking whether a particular library and its headers are available, by attempting to compile a simple program and link against it.
perl-Exporter-Lite	This module is a lightweight version of the core Exporter module, providing a subset of that module's functionality.
perl-ExtUtils-Depends	This module tries to make it easy to build Perl extensions that use functions and typemaps provided by other perl extensions. This means that a perl extension is treated like a shared library that provides also a C and an XS interface besides the perl one.
perl-ExtUtils-PkgConfig	The pkg-config program retrieves information about installed libraries, usually for the purposes of compiling against and linking to them. This module is a very simplistic interface to pkg-config, intended for use in the Makefile.PL of perl extensions which bind libraries that pkg-config knows. It is really just boilerplate code that you would've written yourself.
perl-File-Find-Rule	This module is an alternative interface to the File::Find module.
perl-Math-BigInt-GMP	This module is a replacement library for Math::BigInt::Calc that reimplements some of the Math::BigInt::Calc functions in XS based on GMP.
perl-Statistics-Basic	This module is a collection of very basic statistics modules.
perl-String-CRC32	This packages provides a perl module to generate checksums from strings and from files. The checksums are the same as those calculated by ZMODEM, PKZIP, PICCHECK and many others.
perl-Test-LongString	This is a library to test long strings.
perl-Types-Serialiser	This module provides some extra datatypes that are used by common serialisation formats such as JSON or CBOR. The idea is to have a repository of simple/small constants and containers that can be shared by different implementations so they become interoperable between each other.
perl-Algorithm-Networksort-Chooser	The "algorithm-networksort-chooser" script helps you find the best sorting network for your particular use-case.
