perl-AnyEvent	The DBI of event loop programming - EV, Event, Glib, Tk, UV, Perl, Event::Lib, Irssi, rxvt-unicode, IO::Async, Qt, FLTK and POE are various supported event loops/environments.
perl-Algorithm-Diff	This is a module for computing the difference between two files, two strings, or any other two lists of things.  It uses an intelligent algorithm similar to (or identical to) the one used by the Unix "diff" program.  It is guaranteed to find the *smallest possible* set of differences.
perl-Algorithm-FEC	This is a module for performing Forward Error Correction using Vandermonde Matrices.
perl-Algorithm-Loops	This module provides several functions for doing different types of looping constructs: Filter, MapCar, MapCarU, MapCarE, MapCarMin, NextPermute, NextPermuteNum, and NestedLoops
perl-AnyEvent-HTTP	This module implements a simple, stateless and non-blocking HTTP client. It supports GET, POST and other request methods, cookies and more, all on a very low level. It can follow redirects, supports proxies, and automatically limits the number of connections to the values specified in the RFC.
perl-Astro-FITS-CFITSIO	Astro::FITS::CFITSIO is a Perl interface to William Pence's cfitsio subroutine library. For more information on cfitsio, see http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio .
perl-Async-Interrupt	This module implements a single feature only of interest to advanced perl modules, namely asynchronous interruptions (think "UNIX signals", which are very similar).  It implements asynchronous notifications that enable you to signal running perl code from another thread, asynchronously, and sometimes even without using a single syscall.
perl-Canary-Stability	This module is used by Schmorp's modules during configuration stage to test the installed perl for compatibility with his modules.
perl-Algorithm-Networksort-Chooser	The "algorithm-networksort-chooser" script helps you find the best sorting network for your particular use-case.
