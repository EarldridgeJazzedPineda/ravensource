This directory contains the perl ports generator.

It works recursively -- meaning when provided the cpan metaname of a
port to generate, it will generate all the dependencies of that port,
and their dependencies, etc.

It will accept arguments as cpan metanames of perl ports to build.
If given no arguments, it will use contents of the list.top-ports
file as its build list.

.e.g.	./regenerate_perl_ports.php IO:Tee Starlink::AST
	./regenerate_perl_ports.php

If the switch "--force" is provided, the script will ignore any cached
files and refetch (and overwrite if it has too).

Files to augment over time:
list.top-ports			Main perl ports wanted in Ravenports
list.dead-homepage		List of ports with homepage urls
				that don't resolve
list.https-redirect		List of http:// urls that have permanent
				redirects to https
list.description-override	Keyed table: RP namebase => new description
				(use '\n' to indicate newlines).
list.summary-override		Keyed table: RP namebase => new summary
				(limited to 50 characters)
list.bad-v			List of ports with tarballs with "v" in version
				part of tarball name, but not extracted directory
				Keyed table: RP namebase => specified version
list.index_override		Corrects entries in 02packages.details.txt
				Keyed table: cpan entry => tarball path

Customization:
The generator only produces the specification file, the distinfo file, and
the descriptions/desc.single file.  Maintainers must add the patches,
files, <opsys> directories as needed.  The "USES=perl" module will automatically
create a manifest.

If there is a specification.manual file in the port's directory, it will be
concatenated to the end of the generated specification.

Misc: command to remove trailing whitespace  
perl -pi -e 's,[ \t]+$,,' <filename>
