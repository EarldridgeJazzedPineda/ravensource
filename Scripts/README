With the exception of the Ravenports_Mk directory, these scripts
are not meant to be used by regular users or ravenports developers.

Developers may have a legitimate need to modify:
 -  Ravenports_Mk/GID.ravenports
 -  Ravenports_Mk/UID.ravenports
 -  Ravenports_Mk/raven.information.mk
 -  Ravenports_Mk/raven.versions.mk
 -  Ravenports_Mk/Keywords/*
 -  Ravenports_Mk/Scripts/*
 -  Ravenports_Mk/Uses/*

These files are copied over to Ravenports during the release generation.
