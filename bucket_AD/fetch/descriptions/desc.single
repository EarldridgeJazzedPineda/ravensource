The fetch program is a command-line utility originating with FreeBSD.

command line.

The original implementation of fetch was done by Jean-Marc Zucconi It was
extensively re-worked for FreeBSD 2.2 by Garrett Wollman , and later
completely rewritten to use the fetch(3) library by Dag-Erling Smorgrav
and Michael Gmelin.
