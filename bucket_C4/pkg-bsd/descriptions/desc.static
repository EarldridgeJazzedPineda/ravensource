The pkg program is the package management tool used natively on FreeBSD and
DragonFly, and has also been successfully demonstrated on NetBSD, OpenBSD
and Darwin.

It is one of the package managers available for the manipulation of both
locally-built and remotely available binary packages.

This package contains just the statically-linked version (pkg-static).
