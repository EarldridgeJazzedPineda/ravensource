Skalibs is a set of general-purpose C libraries used for skarnet.org 
software. It can also be used as a sound basic start for C development if 
small and secure C code with a focus on system programming is a goal. 
Skalibs provide APIs more suited to secure and efficient system 
programming than the libc, especially where network programming and IPCs 
are concerned.
