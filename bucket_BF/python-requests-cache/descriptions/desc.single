## Summary
**requests-cache** is a persistent HTTP cache that provides an easy way to
get better
performance with the python [requests] library.

## Features
* üç∞ **Ease of use:** Keep using the `requests` library you're already
familiar with. Add caching
  with a [drop-in replacement]
  for `requests.Session`, or
  [install globally]
  to add transparent caching to all `requests` functions.
* üöÄ **Performance:** Get sub-millisecond response times for cached
responses. When they expire, you
  still save time with
  [conditional requests].
* üíæ **Persistence:** Works with several
  [storage backends]
  including SQLite, Redis, MongoDB, and DynamoDB; or save responses as
plain JSON files, YAML,
  and more
* üïó **Expiration:** Use
  [Cache-Control]
  and other standard HTTP headers, define your own expiration schedule,
keep your cache clutter-free
  with backends that natively support TTL, or any combination of strategies
* ‚öôÔ∏è **Customization:** Works out of the box with zero config, but with
a robust set of features for
  configuring and extending the library to suit your needs
* üß© **Compatibility:** Can be combined with other
  [popular libraries based on requests]

## Quickstart
First, install with pip:
```bash
pip install requests-cache
```

Then, use [requests_cache.CachedSession]
to make your requests. It behaves like a normal
[requests.Session],
but with caching behavior.

To illustrate, we'll call an endpoint that adds a delay of 1 second,
simulating a slow or
rate-limited website.

**This takes 1 minute:**
```python
import requests

session = requests.Session()
for i in range(60):
    session.get('https://httpbin.org/delay/1')
```

**This takes 1 second:**
```python
import requests_cache

session = requests_cache.CachedSession('demo_cache')
for i in range(60):
    session.get('https://httpbin.org/delay/1')
```

With caching, the response will be fetched once, saved to
`demo_cache.sqlite`, and subsequent
requests will return the cached response near-instantly.

### Patching
If you don't want to manage a session object, or just want to quickly test
it out in your
application without modifying any code, requests-cache can also be
installed globally, and all
requests will be transparently cached:
```python
import requests
import requests_cache

requests_cache.install_cache('demo_cache')
requests.get('https://httpbin.org/delay/1')
```
