commonmark: High Performance CommonMark and Github Markdown Rendering in R

The CommonMark specification &lt;<a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/"
target="_top">https://github.github.com/gfm/</a>&gt; defines a rationalized
version of markdown syntax. This package uses the 'cmark' reference
implementation for converting markdown text into various formats including
html, latex and groff man. In addition it exposes the markdown parse tree
in xml format. Also includes opt-in support for GFM extensions including
tables, autolinks, and strikethrough text.
