eddington: Compute a Cyclist's Eddington Number

Compute a cyclist's Eddington number, including efficiently computing
cumulative E over a vector. A cyclist's Eddington number &lt;<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Eddington#Eddington_number_for_cycling">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Eddington#Eddington_number_for_cycling</a>&gt;
is the maximum number satisfying the condition such that a cyclist has
ridden E miles or greater in E days. The algorithm in this package is an
improvement over the conventional approach because both summary statistics
and cumulative statistics can be computed in linear time, since it does not
require initial sorting of the data. These functions may also be used for
computing h-indices for authors, a metric described by Hirsch (2005) &lt;<a

Both are specific applications of computing the side length of a Durfee
square &lt;<a
