GtkDatabox is a widget to display large sets of data as dots (or lines). 
Different data sets will have different colors, you may change both colors 
and style of the data. The widget gives the possibility to zoom in and out 
of the data representation and to scroll around. It also offers a grid 
like on an oscilloscope.
