The main reason of this library is transformate relative paths to
absolute at the "BEGIN" stage, and push transformed to @INC. Relative
path basis is not the current working directory, but the location of
file, where the statement is (caller file). When using common "lib",
relative paths stays relative to curernt working directory.
