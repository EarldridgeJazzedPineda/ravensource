This module compiles a simple comparison to an anonymous subroutine, which
you can call with a value to be tested again. The target value may use
magnitudes of kilobytes (k, ki), megabytes (m, mi), or gigabytes (g, gi).
Those suffixed with an i use the appropriate 2**n version in accordance
with the IEC standard: http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html
