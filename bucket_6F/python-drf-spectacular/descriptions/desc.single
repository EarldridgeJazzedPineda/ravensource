Sane and flexible `OpenAPI`_ (`3.0.3`_ & `3.1`_) schema generation for
`Django REST framework`_.

This project has 3 goals:
    1. Extract as much schema information from DRF as possible.
    2. Provide flexibility to make the schema usable in the real world (not
only toy examples).
    3. Generate a schema that works well with the most popular client
generators.

The code is a heavily modified fork of the
[DRF OpenAPI generator],
which is/was lacking all of the below listed features.

Features
    - Serializers modelled as components. (arbitrary nesting and recursion
supported)
    - `@extend_schema
<https://drf-spectacular.readthedocs.io/en/latest/drf_spectacular.html#drf_spectacular.utils.extend_schema>`_
decorator for customization of APIView, Viewsets, function-based views, and
``@action``
        - additional parameters
        - request/response serializer override (with status codes)
        - polymorphic responses either manually with
PolymorphicProxySerializer helper or via rest_polymorphic's
PolymorphicSerializer)
        -
