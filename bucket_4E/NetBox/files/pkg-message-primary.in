Please note that NetBox requires a PostgreSQL database server, which uses its
built-in network address datatypes. Thus NetBox won't work with other RDBMS's,
e.g. MySQL, MariaDB, etc.

For installation instructions please refer to the related wiki page:

As always it is strongly encouraged to make a backup of the database before the
database migrations will be executed.

The following steps are required to finish the upgrade: 

1. Run database migrations, trace any missing cable paths, build the embedded
   documentation, collect static files, remove stale content files, delete any
   expired user sessions and clear the cache.

# cd %%PREXIX%%/share/netbox
# python%%PYTHON_VER%% manage.py migrate
# python%%PYTHON_VER%% manage.py trace_paths --no-input
# mkdocs build
# python%%PYTHON_VER%% manage.py collectstatic --no-input
# python%%PYTHON_VER%% manage.py remove_stale_contenttypes --no-input
# python%%PYTHON_VER%% manage.py clearsessions
# python%%PYTHON_VER%% manage.py clearcache

2. Restart WSGI/httpd environment (supervisord/apache/nginx/etc.)
