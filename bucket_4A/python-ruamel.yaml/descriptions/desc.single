ruamel.yaml
===========

ruamel.yaml is a YAML 1.2 loader/dumper package for Python.

:version: 0.16.10 :updated: 2020-02-12 :documentation:
http://yaml.readthedocs.io :repository: https://bitbucket.org/ruamel/yaml
:pypi: https://pypi.org/project/ruamel.yaml/

Starting with version 0.15.0 the way YAML files are loaded and dumped is
changing. See the API doc for details. Currently existing functionality
will throw a warning before being changed/removed. **For production systems
you should pin the version being used with ruamel.yaml<=0.15**. There might
be bug fixes in the 0.14 series, but new functionality is likely only to be
available via the new API.

If your package uses ruamel.yaml and is not listed on PyPI, drop me an
email, preferably with some information on how you use the package (or a
link to bitbucket/github) and I'll keep you informed when the status of the
API is stable enough to make the transition.

* [Overview])

0.16.6 (2020-01-20):  - fix empty string mapping key roundtripping with
preservation of quotes as [? ''`  (reported via email by Tomer Aharoni).  -
fix incorrect state setting in class constructor (reported by `Douglas
Raillard  ])  - adjust deprecation warning test for Hashable, as that no
longer warns (reported  by [Jason Montleon])

0.16.5 (2019-08-18):  - allow for YAML(typ=['unsafe', 'pytypes'])

0.16.3 (2019-08-15):  - split construct_object  - change stuff back to keep

correctly output #  in URL for YAML 1.2 (both reported by [Thomas Smith  ])

0.16.1 (2019-08-08):  - Force the use of new version of ruamel.yaml.clib
(reported by [Alex Joz  ])  - Allow '#' in tag URI as these are allowed in
YAML 1.2 (reported by  [Thomas Smith  ])

0.16.0 (2019-07-25):  - split of C source that generates .so file to
ruamel.yaml.clib  - duplicate keys are now an error when working with the
old API as well

0.15.99 (2019-07-12):  - add [py.typed` to distribution, based on a PR
submitted by  `Michael Crusoe  ]  - merge PR 40 (also by Michael Crusoe) to
more accurately specify  repository in the README (also reported in a
misunderstood issue  some time ago)

0.15.98 (2019-07-09):  - regenerate ext/_ruamel_yaml.c with Cython version
0.29.12, needed  for Python 3.8.0b2 (reported by [John Vandenberg  ])

0.15.97 (2019-06-06):  - regenerate ext/_ruamel_yaml.c with Cython version
0.29.10, needed for  Python 3.8.0b1  - regenerate ext/_ruamel_yaml.c with

Sottile  ])

0.15.96 (2019-05-16):  - fix failure to indent comments on round-trip
anchored block style  scalars in block sequence (reported by [William
Kimball  ])

0.15.95 (2019-05-16):  - fix failure to round-trip anchored scalars in
block sequence  (reported by [William Kimball  ])  - wheel files for Python
3.4 no longer provided ([Python 3.4 EOL 2019-03-18  ])

0.15.94 (2019-04-23):  - fix missing line-break after end-of-file comments
not ending in  line-break (reported by [Philip Thompson  ])

0.15.93 (2019-04-21):  - fix failure to parse empty implicit flow mapping

0.15.92 (2019-04-16):  - fix failure to parse empty implicit block mapping
key (reported by   [Nolan W])

0.15.91 (2019-04-05):  - allowing duplicate keys would not work for merge
