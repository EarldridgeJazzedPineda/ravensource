libmatroska is a C++ libary to parse and create Matroska files.

Matroska aims to become THE standard of multimedia container formats. It
was derived from a project called MCF, but differentiates from it
significantly because it is based on EBML (Extensible Binary Meta
Language), a binary derivative of XML. EBML enables the Matroska
Development Team to gain significant advantages in terms of future format
extensibility, without breaking file support in old parsers.
