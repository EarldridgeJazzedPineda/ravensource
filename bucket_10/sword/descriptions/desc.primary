The SWORD Project is the CrossWire Bible Society's free Bible software 
project. Its purpose is to create cross-platform open-source tools that 
allow programmers and Bible societies to write new Bible software more 
quickly and easily. We also create Bible study software for all readers, 
students, scholars, and translators of the Bible, and have a growing 
collection of many hundred texts in around 100 languages.
