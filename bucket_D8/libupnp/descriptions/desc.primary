The Portable SDK for UPnP(tm) Devices is an SDK for development of UPnP 
device and control point applications. It consists of the core UPnP 
protocols along with a UPnP-specific eXtensible Markup Language (XML) 
parser supporting the Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 API and an 
optional, integrated mini web server for serving UPnP related documents. 
It provides developers with an API and open source code for building 
control points, devices, and bridges that are compliant with Version 1.0 
of the Universal Plug and Play Device Architecture Specification and 
supports several operating systems like Linux, *BSD, Solaris and others.
