## What is new?

Please check the [ChangeLog] file for the detailed information.

DeepDiff 6-3-0

- `PrefixOrSuffixOperator`: This operator will skip strings that are suffix
or prefix of each other.
- `include_obj_callback` and `include_obj_callback_strict` are added by
[HÃ¥vard Thom].
- Fixed a corner case where numpy's `np.float32` nans are not ignored when
using `ignore_nan_equality` by [Noam Gottlieb]
- `orjson` becomes optional again.
- Fix for `ignore_type_in_groups` with numeric values so it does not report
number changes when the number types are different.

DeepDiff 6-2-0

- Major improvement in the diff report for lists when items are all
hashable and the order of items is important.

# ChangeLog

Please take a look at the [CHANGELOG] file.

# Contribute

1. Please make your PR against the dev branch
2. Please make sure that your PR has tests. Since DeepDiff is used in many
sensitive data driven projects, we strive to maintain around 100% test
coverage on the code.

Please run `pytest --cov=deepdiff --runslow` to see the coverage report.
Note that the `--runslow` flag will run some slow tests too. In most cases
you only want to run the fast tests which so you wont add the `--runslow`
flag.

Or to see a more user friendly version, please run: `pytest --cov=deepdiff
--cov-report term-missing --runslow`.

Thank you!
