### A message from Sep, the creator of DeepDiff

> 👋 Hi there,
>
> Thank you for using DeepDiff!
> As an engineer, I understand the frustration of wrestling with **unruly
data** in pipelines.
> That's why I developed a new tool - [Qluster] to empower non-engineers to
control and resolve data issues at scale autonomously and **stop bugging
the engineers**! 🛠️
>
> If you are going through this pain now, I would love to give you [early
access] to Qluster and get your feedback.
