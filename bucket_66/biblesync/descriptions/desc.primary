BibleSync is a C++ single class library encapsulating a protocol conduit. 
The premise is that there is a local network over which to multicast Bible 
navigation, and someone, possibly several someones, will transmit, and 
others will receive. The choices for when you decide to xmit and what to 
do when you recv are up to you as the application designer.
