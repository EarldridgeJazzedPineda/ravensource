sh is a full-fledged subprocess replacement for Python 3.8 - 3.11, and PyPy
that allows you to call *any* program as if it were a function:

.. code:: python

    from sh import ifconfig
    print(ifconfig("eth0"))

sh is *not* a collection of system commands implemented in Python.

sh relies on various Unix system calls and only works on Unix-like
operating
systems - Linux, macOS, BSDs etc. Specifically, Windows is not supported.

Testing
-------

Tests are run in a docker container against all supported Python versions.
To run, make the following target::

    $> make test

To run a single test::

    $> make test='FunctionalTests.test_background' test_one

Coverage
--------

First run all of the tests::

    $> SH_TESTS_RUNNING=1 coverage run --source=sh -m pytest

This will aggregate a ``.coverage``.  You may then visualize the report
with::

    $> coverage report

Or generate visual html files with::

    $> coverage html

Which will create ``./htmlcov/index.html`` that you may open in a web
browser.
