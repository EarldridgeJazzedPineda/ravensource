This module is under active development. It is designed to provide a pure
Python convenience library capable of parsing and comparing package and
version strings for a variety of packaging standards. Whenever possible,
the exact logic of existing package management comparison standards will
be implemented so that users can trust that the results are equivalent to
what they would get on the command-line.
