## Typing stubs for pytz

This is a [PEP 561]
type stub package for the [`pytz`] package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy],
[pyright],
[pytype],
[Pyre],
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses `pytz`. This version of
`types-pytz` aims to provide accurate annotations for
`pytz==2025.2`.

This package is part of the [typeshed project].
All fixes for types and metadata should be contributed there.
See [the README]
for more details. The source for this package can be found in the
[`stubs/pytz`]
directory.

This package was tested with
mypy 1.15.0,
pyright 1.1.397,
and pytype 2024.10.11.
It was generated from typeshed commit
[`4fff7b7d0165120bf79928534c88dffffdcb5da2`].
