libdbi implements a database-independent abstraction layer in C, similar
to the DBI/DBD layer in Perl. Writing one generic set of code, programmers
can leverage the power of multiple databases and multiple simultaneous
database connections by using this framework.

The libdbi-drivers project provides the database-specific drivers for the
libdbi framework. The current version of libdbi-drivers will work with any
0.9.x release of the framework.

This package contains the PostgreSQL driver.
