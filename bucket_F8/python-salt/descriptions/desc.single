SaltStack takes a new approach to infrastructure management by developing 
software that is easy enough to get running in seconds, scalable enough to 
manage tens of thousands of servers, and fast enough to control and 
communicate with them in milliseconds. SaltStack delivers a dynamic 
infrastructure communication bus used for orchestration, remote execution, 
configuration management and much more.
