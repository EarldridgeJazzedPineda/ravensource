The GNU implementation of awk is called gawk; it is fully upward
compatible with the System V Release 4 version of awk.  gawk is also
upward compatible with the POSIX specification of the awk language.
This means that all properly written awk programs should work with gawk.
Thus, usually no distinction between gawk and other awk implemenations
is made.
