workflowsets: Create a Collection of 'tidymodels' Workflows

A workflow is a combination of a model and preprocessors (e.g, a formula,
recipe, etc.) (Kuhn and Silge (2021) &lt;<a href="https://www.tmwr.org/"

combinations of these, an object can be created that contains many
workflows. There are functions to create workflows en masse as well as
training them and visualizing the results.
