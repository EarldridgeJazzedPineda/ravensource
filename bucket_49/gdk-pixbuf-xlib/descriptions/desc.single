GdkPixbuf-Xlib contains the deprecated API for integrating GdkPixbuf with 
Xlib data types. It originally shipped with gdk-pixbuf but has since been 
moved out of the main repository.

This legacy library exists only for old code bases which still require it. 
Any project still using it is strongly encouraged to port away from it.
