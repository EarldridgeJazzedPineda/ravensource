The reusable library known as the GNAT Component Collection (GNATColl)
is based on one main principle: general-purpose packages that are part of
the GNAT technology should also be available to user application code.
The compiler front end, the GNAT Programming Studio (GPS) Interactive
Development Environment, and the GNAT Tracker web-based interface all
served as sources for the components.

This variant focuses on Project support (the manipulation of gpr
files).  The standard variant should be used for generally instead.
