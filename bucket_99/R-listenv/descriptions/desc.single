listenv: Environments Behaving (Almost) as Lists

List environments are environments that have list-like properties. For
instance, the elements of a list environment are ordered and can be
accessed and iterated over using index subsetting, e.g. 'x &lt;- listenv(a
= 1, b = 2); for (i in seq_along(x)) x[[i]] &lt;- x[[i]] ^ 2; y &lt;-
as.list(x)'.
