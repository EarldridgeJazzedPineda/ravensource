What is this?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| fontTools is a library for manipulating fonts, written in Python. The
  project includes the TTX tool, that can convert TrueType and OpenType
  fonts to and from an XML text format, which is also called TTX. It
  supports TrueType, OpenType, AFM and to an extent Type 1 and some
  Mac-specific formats. The project has an `MIT open-source
  licence <LICENSE>`__.
| Among other things this means you can use it free of charge.

[User documentation] and
[developer documentation]
are available at [Read the Docs].

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

FontTools 4.x requires [Python] 3.6
or later. FontTools 3.x requires Python 2.7 or later.

**NOTE** From August 2019, until no later than January 1 2020, the support
for *Python 2.7* will be limited to only critical bug fixes, and no new
features
will be added to the py27 branch. You can read more [here]
and [here] for the
reasons behind this decision.

The package is listed in the Python Package Index (PyPI), so you can

  explicitly set, the latter are assumed to be 0 (#2323).

4.23.1 (released 2021-05-14)
----------------------------

  both v0 and v1 color glyphs when the subset only requested v1 glyphs; we
were
  not pruning the v0 portion of the table (#2308).
