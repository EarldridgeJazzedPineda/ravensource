roxygen2: In-Line Documentation for R

Generate your Rd documentation, 'NAMESPACE' file, and collation field using
specially formatted comments. Writing documentation in-line with code makes
it easier to keep your documentation up-to-date as your requirements
change. 'roxygen2' is inspired by the 'Doxygen' system for C++.
