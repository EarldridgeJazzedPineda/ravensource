ConsoleKit is a framework for defining and tracking users, login sessions, 
and seats. It allows multiple users to be logged in at the same time and 
share hardware for their graphical session. ConsoleKit will keep track of 
those resources and whichever session is active will have use of the 
hardware at that time.

ConsoleKit2 is a fork of the ConsoleKit since that is no longer maintained 
(freedesktop chose to use logind instead).
