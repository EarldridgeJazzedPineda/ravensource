While "tie" in perldoc allows tying to an arbitrary object, the class in
question must support this in it's implementation of TIEHASH, TIEARRAY or
whatever. This class provides a very tie constructor that simply returns
the object it was given as it's first argument; this way side effects of
calling $object->TIEHASH are avoided.
