Setuptools is a fully-featured, actively-maintained, and stable library
designed to facilitate packaging Python projects.

It helps developers to easily share reusable code (in library form) and
programs (e.g., CLI/GUI tools implemented in Python), that can be installed
with pip and uploaded to PyPI.
