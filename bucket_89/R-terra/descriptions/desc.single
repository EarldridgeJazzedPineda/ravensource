terra: Spatial Data Analysis

Methods for spatial data analysis with vector (points, lines, polygons) and
raster (grid) data. Methods for vector data include standard operations
such as intersect and buffer. Raster methods include global, local, zonal,
and focal computations. The predict and interpolate methods facilitate the
use of regression type (interpolation, machine learning) models for spatial
prediction, including with satellite remote sensing data. Processing of
very large files is supported. See the manual and tutorials on &lt;<a
href="https://rspatial.org/terra/">https://rspatial.org/terra/</a>&gt; to
get started. 'terra' is a replacement for the 'raster' package ('terra' can
do more, and it is faster and easier to use).
