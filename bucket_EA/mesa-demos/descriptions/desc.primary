The Mesa Demos package contains a large number of OpenGL demonstration and 
test programs.

These programs were previously distributed with the Mesa libraries. The 
demos are separated now since they don't change often and aren't tied to a 
particular version of Mesa.

Note that the Mesa demos should be usable with any OpenGL implementation; 
not just Mesa.
