Marco is a fork of GNOME's Metacity. It is described as a "boring window 
manager for the adult in you". While it strives for good compliance with 
the EWMH window manager standard, Marco tries to stand back as much as 
possible. It leaves all the user-facing things to the actual desktop 
environment and thus is not of too much use on its own.
