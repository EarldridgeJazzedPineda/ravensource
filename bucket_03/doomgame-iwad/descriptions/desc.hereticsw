Heretic is a dark fantasy first-person shooter game developed by Raven software and released in 1994. It uses a modified version of the Doom engine that supports new features like looking up and down as well as an inventory. The player can collect several magic artifacts and use them later. Those include among others: Health potions, an ancient tome that temporarily boosts weapons or the wings of wrath which enable fly-mode.

The first of the three original episodes, "City of the damned", was released as shareware.

This package contains the IWAD (resource container) file for the Heretic shareware.
