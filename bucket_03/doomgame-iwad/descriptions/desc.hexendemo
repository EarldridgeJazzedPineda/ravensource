HeXen is an apocalyptic fantasy first-person shooter by Raven software. Published in 1995 it is the sequel to Heretic and uses a heavily improved Doom engine with higher resolution and many new features. HeXen lets the player choose one of three characters (a warrior, a priest or a mage). Each class has unique weapons and attributes such as toughness, power, and moving speed. Therefor different tactics are necessary to beat the game depending on the class chosen.

Due to introducing hub levels, the game is largely non-linear as previously visited levels can be entered again. HeXen includes several large-scale puzzles. By completing parts of a puzzle new areas in various levels open up. The goal of each hub is to complete the puzzle, defeat the boss and get to the next hub. The engine features so-called ACS scripts. The scripting makes the world much more dynamic and allows for the cross-level puzzles.

A four-level demo version was released for interested people to try out.

This package contains the IWAD (resource container) file for the HeXen demo.
